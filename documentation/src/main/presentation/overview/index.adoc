= Talend Component Overview
Romain Manni-Bucau
:revnumber: {project_version}

== Goal

[%step]
* Unify the development of _components_
** Standalone
** BEAM/big data
* Simplify the testing of _components_ and their _representation_ (UI)
* Provide a centralized metadata repository

== Programming Model

[%step]
* Declarative
** Limit the required code as much as possible
** No required registration classes
** Extensible (allows to support new features of underlying runtimes)
* Minimal
** No duplication of metadata (runtime configuration and UI for instance)
** Ensure support for all target environments

== Runtime

[%step]
* Isolate plugins to limit their conflicts (dependencies)
* Tree classloading to not bring in the graph (OSGi for instance) linking complexity

== Build

[%step]
* Stay close to Maven (repository) but local:
** Limit the duplication of artifacts
** Known layout and resolution
* Fatjar friendly (big data target)
* Maven plugin(s)
** Common validations of components (model, i18n etc...)
** Packaging (fatjar with nested maven repository, plugin listing etc...)

== Testing

[%step]
* JUnit support
** Ability to reuse existing features (`Parameterized`, `@Rule`, ...)
** Component easy to test (like any code)
** Advanced testing with big data cluster testing? (see spark IT in runtime project)

== Thanks

= Talend Component Testing
Romain Manni-Bucau
:revnumber: {project_version}

== Disclaimer

* At that time this document is a draft and target, no runtime is provided yet

== Scope and goals

* Be able to test components quickly
* Centralize best practises
* Enable to test standalone and big data pipelines

== Best practises

* Should have their own subcontext on the documentation website
* Should be example driven and not theorical
* Runnable examples should be downloadable directly

== Test framework

* JUnit based (reuse of `Parameterized`, `Rule` etc...)
* Best practise around test data samples generation?
* Rules for big data (`SparkClusterRule`, potentially others?)

public class SparkClusterIT {
    @ClassRule
    public static final SparkClusterRule SPARK =
        new SparkClusterRule("2.10", "1.6.3", 1 /*slave*/);

    @Test
    public void run() throws IOException {
        SPARK.submit(Main.class, getTestMainArgs());
        doTestAssertOutput();
    }
}

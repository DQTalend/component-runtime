== Introducing Talend Component

_Talend Component_ intends to simplify the development of connectors at two main levels:

Runtime:: how to inject the specific component code into a job or pipeline. It should unify as much as possible the code required to run in DI and BEAM environments.
Graphical interfaces:: unify the code required to be able to render in a browser (web) or the eclipse based Studio (SWT).

= Talend Component Kit Extension Points
:page-talend_skipindexation:

This pages lists most of the extension points the framework provides for integrators.

== Customize the isolation

This can be useful to customize which libraries are shared accross all components - to inject a new global service - or prevent some libraries to be laoded from components even if provided in the `dependencies.txt`.

The entry point to do that is the `org.talend.sdk.component.runtime.manager.ComponentManager.Customizer` SPI:

[source,java]
----
// don't forget the META-INF/services/org.talend.sdk.component.runtime.manager.ComponentManager$Customizer file containing the fully qualified name of this class
public class MyCustomizer implements ComponentManager.Customizer {
    @Override
    public Stream<String> containerClassesAndPackages() {
        return asList("com.company.shared", "com.othercompany.sharedtoo");
    }
}
----

== Handle the beam isolation in a custom fashion

If you import `component-runtime-beam`, Apache Beam SDK will be isolated by default. However, in some cases or some environment,
you will desire to handle it yourself in a more precise manner.

If you want to prevent Talend Component Kit to isolate itself Apache Beam from components, you can implement a `Customizer` - see previous part,
and the `ignoreBeamClassLoaderExclusions` method:

[source,java]
----
// don't forget the META-INF/services/org.talend.sdk.component.runtime.manager.ComponentManager$Customizer file containing the fully qualified name of this class
public class MyCustomizer implements ComponentManager.Customizer {
    @Override
    public Stream<String> containerClassesAndPackages() {
        return singletonList("org.apache.beam."); // likely too wide since IO are generally isolated
    }

    @Override
    public boolean ignoreBeamClassLoaderExclusions() {
        return true;
    }
}
----

== ParameterExtensionEnricher

The option model of the configuration of the component is pluggable to enable to add any custom metadata needed.
It relies on `ParameterExtensionEnricher` SPI which can be seen as a visitor API for annotations on options.
Each annotation is then converted in a map of properties.

IMPORTANT: it is highly recommended to scope the entries in the map using a dedicated prefix.

Some meta annotation - like `@Ui` - enable to add metadata without adding an enricher.
Typically if you have an annotation with `@Ui` on it, then your annotation will be processed by the default ui enricher and will not need to register a custom one.

Finally, this API enables to add implicitly annotation on options based on their type. For instance, for `ZonedDateTime` we add implicitly - no user action - the annotation `@DateTime`.

== Handle component dependencies in a custom fashion

If you want to read the dependencies of the component in a fully custom fashion, you can disable it through the `Customizer` returning `true` in `ignoreDefaultDependenciesDescriptor`.
Then, you will need to implement `org.talend.sdk.component.runtime.manager.ComponentManager$ContainerClasspathContributor` (it is a SPI too).

TIP: the contributor is used even if no customizer disabled dependencies, this means you can use it to *enrich* component classpath and not only redefine it.

== Enrich the classpath of the server

The component server is a plain link:http://openwebbeans.apache.org/meecrowave/[Apache Meecrowave] server and therefore a plain Java process.

To add your custom extensions to it, you just have to add your `.jar` in its classpath.

For the docker image, you can use the `/opt/talend/component-kit/custom` folder to host all the extensions (+ their dependencies if neeed).

WARNING: if you add extensions which are required at rutime too - like modifying the way Apache Beam is handled or the isolation is defined, don't forget to also add your extension to your runtime.

== Modify the way the UiSpec is generated

`component-form` enables to generate to UiSpec for a component configuration. It has good defaults aligned on `@talend/ui`, however if you have some advanced needs, you can customize the way it computes the specification.

First, the `org.talend.sdk.component.form.api.UiSpecService#withConverter` method of the service enables to add custom handlers for property mapping.
A converter will be responsible to convert a component option to its rendering specification if it supports the property.
It can also reuse existing converters if needed:

[source,java]
----
pulic class MyConverter implements CustomPropertyConverter {
    @Override
    public boolean supports(final PropertyContext<?> context) {
        return context.getProperty().getName().equals("entry");
    }

    @Override
    public CompletionStage<PropertyContext<?>> convert(
            final CompletionStage<PropertyContext<?>> context,
            final ConverterContext converterContext) {
        return new DataListWidgetConverter(converterContext.getSchemas(),
                converterContext.getProperties(), converterContext.getActions(),
                converterContext.getClient(), converterContext.getFamily(),
                converterContext.getJsonSchema(), converterContext.getLang()) {

            @Override
            protected CompletionStage<PropertyContext<?>> fillProposalsAndReturn(
                    final PropertyContext<?> context, final UiSchema schema,
                    final JsonSchema jsonSchema) {
                schema
                        .setTitleMap(singletonList(new UiSchema.NameValue.Builder()
                                .withName("a")
                                .withValue("A")
                                .build()));
                jsonSchema.setEnumValues(singletonList("A"));
                return completedFuture(context);
            }
        }.convert(context);
    }
}
----

The other extension point of `UiSpecService` which is often useful to combine with the previous one if the context available in the convertion process.
Typically, the `PropertyContext` gives access to a `context` through `getContext()` getter and this is the instance passed to the `convert` method of the service.
This is very useful to pass a context to the convertion and change the rendering depending it - potentially even the user and its permissions if you set it in the context.

== Apache Beam Integration: Registry coder

`SchemaRegistryCoder` provides a way to share seen Avro schemas accross the execution cluster (Big Data engine).
It is based on two main concepts:

1. Its protocol: it writes the schema identifier then the schema itself,
2. A storage allowing to share the written schemas accross nodes.

By default an in memory storage is used but you can plug you own implementation through the SPI `org.talend.sdk.component.runtime.beam.coder.registry.SchemaRegistry`.
This class defines two hooks: where to store a schema and how to retrieve an existing schema.

A trivial distributed implementation can rely on Hazelcast:

[source,java]
----
@Slf4j
public class InMemorySchemaRegistry implements SchemaRegistry {

    private final Map<String, Schema> schemas = Hazelcast.getOrCreateHazelcastInstance().getMap(getClass().getName());

    @Override
    public void putIfAbsent(final String id, final Schema schema) {
        schemas.putIfAbsent(id, schema);
    }

    @Override
    public Schema get(final String id) {
        return schemas.get(id);
    }
}
----

== Implement virtual components

Sometimes it is possible to implement components on the fly without having to generate the code itself - for instance you can generate a family OpenAPI based just adding on the fly the openapi.json descriptor.

For that case, the framework has multiple extension points:

1. `org.talend.sdk.component.spi.component.GenericComponentExtension` (a SPI) which is responsible to instantiate components in a generic manner,
2.  `org.talend.sdk.component.server.configuration.ComponentServerConfiguration` is a CDI event - use `void onSetup(@Observes ComponentServerConfiguration config)` to observe it - which will enable to register virtual components. It is available in `component-server-extension-api` module.

A sample can be seen on github through link:https://github.com/Talend/component-runtime/tree/component-runtime-1.1.9/component-server-parent/extensions/stitch[stitch PoC] module.

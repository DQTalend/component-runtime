== What is a producer

AÂ `Producer` is a component interacting with a physical source. It produces input data for the processing flow.

A producer is a simple component that must have a `@Producer` method without any parameter. It can return any data:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Producer
public MyData produces() {
    return ...;
}

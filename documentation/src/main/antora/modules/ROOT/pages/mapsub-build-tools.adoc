= Build tools
:page-partial:

To develop new components, Talend Component Kit requires a build tool in which you will import the component project generated from the starter. With this build tool, you will also be able to implement the logic of your component and to install and deploy it to Talend applications.

A Talend Component Kit plugin is available for each of the supported build tools.

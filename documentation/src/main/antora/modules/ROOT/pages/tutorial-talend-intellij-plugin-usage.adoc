== How the i18n completion works
This feature offer auto completion for configuration i18n.
Talend component configuration let you setup translatable, user friendly labels for you configuration using properties file.
This plugin will provide some completion in those properties file for the configuration keys and default values.

Let's say that you have simple configuration class for a basic authentication that you will use in your component.

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes",]
----
@Checkable("basicAuth")
@DataStore("basicAuth")
@GridLayout({
        @GridLayout.Row({ "url" }),
        @GridLayout.Row({ "username", "password" }),
})
public class BasicAuthConfig implements Serializable {

    @Option
    private String url;

    @Option
    private String username;

    @Option
    @Credential
    private String password;
}
----

This configuration classs contains 3 properties that you may want to attach some user friendly labels to them.

For example: You may want the `url` option to have a label like `My awesome server URL`.

For this you will need to create a `Messages.properties` file in the project resources to be able to add your labels.

The plugin will automatically detect you configuration and provide you with keys completion in the properties file.

= Talend Component Studio Integration
:page-partial:

== Design

The studio integration relies on Component Server (see <<documentation-rest.adoc#, Web>> for more details).

When the plugin is deployed it starts a local server the Studio uses to gather data about the components.

== Installation

Copy `org.talend.sdk.component.studio-integration.jar` in the `$STUDIO_HOME/plugins` directory and restart the studio.

Also ensure the `component-server` dependencies  and `commons-cli` 1.4 are into the Studio maven repository. If you install any component,
ensure its dependencies are in the repository as well.

TIP: you can set in `$STUDIO_HOME/configuration/config.ini` the value `maven.repository` to `global` to reuse
your local maven repository.

== Configuration

The configuration goes into `$STUDIO_HOME/configuration/config.ini`.

|===
| Name | Description | Default
| component.environment | Active the developer mode when set to `dev` | -
| component.debounce.timeout | Specifies timeout in milliseconds before calling listeners in components Text fields | 750
| component.kit.skip | If `true` the plugin is not active. Useful if you don't have any component develop with the framework. | false
| component.java.arguments | Component server additional options | -
| component.java.m2 | The maven repository the server uses to resolve components | default to global Studio configuration
| component.java.coordinates | A list of comma separated GAV (groupId:artifactId:version) of components to register | -
| component.java.registry | A properties file with values matching component GAV (groupId:artifactId:version) which are registered at startup | -
| component.java.port | Set a port to use for the server | random
| components.server.beam.active | Active, if set to true, beam support (_Experimental_). It requires beam sdk java core dependencies to be available. | false

| component.server.jul.forceConsole
a| Adds a console handler to JUL to see logs in the console. This can be helpful in dev since the formatting will be better than the OSGi one in `workspace/.metadata/.log`.

NOTE: it uses `java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format` property to define its format. Default
is `%1$tb %1$td, %1$tY %1$tl:%1$tM:%1$tS %1$Tp %2$s%n%4$s: %5$s%6$s%n` but for development purposes
`[%4$s] %5$s%6$s%n` is simpler and more readable.

| false
|===

IMPORTANT: to activate the plugin and be able to deploy your component, don't forget to set `component.kit.skip` to `true`.

A common developer `configuration/config.ini` will use the following specific entries:

.configuration/config.ini
[source,properties]
----
# use local .m2 instead of embedded studio one
maven.repository = global

# load these component modules
component.java.coordinates = \
    group1:artifact1:0.0.1,\
    group2:artifact2:0.2.1

# during development, see developer model part
component.environment = dev

# log into the console the component interactions - optional
component.server.jul.forceConsole = true
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format = [%4$s] %5$s%6$s%n
----

=== Random port when running concurrent studio instances

If you run multiple Studio instance automatically in parallel you can have some issues with the random port computation
(can happen on a CI platform). For that purpose you can create the file `$HOME/.talend/locks/org.talend.sdk.component.studio-integration.lock`.

When a server will start it will acquire a lock on that file and prevent another one to get a port until it is started. It ensures
you can't get two concurrent processes getting the same allocated port.

IMPORTANT: it is highly unlikely it happens on a desktop and forcing a different value through `component.java.port` in your `config.ini` is likely a better
solution for local installations.

=== Developer mode

The developer mode will add a Talend Component Kit button in the main toolbar:

image::studio-reload-button.png[Studio Reload Button]

When clicking on this button, all component developped with the framework will be reloaded.
The cache will be invalidated and the component refreshed.

IMPORTANT: you still need to add/remove the components to see the changes.

This feature is very useful to see some updates in components without having to restart the studio completly.

Dev vs CI Setup

xref:tutorial-test-rest-api.adoc[In a previous tutorial], we have shown how to create mocked tests for our Zendesk search component.
Those mocked tests are very useful to test on a development environment, but we still have to execute our tests with real interaction with the API,
to be sure that everything continue to work correctly on a CI server for example.

To achieve that, you will need to configure the xref:testing-http.adoc[API simulation tool] to run in the `passthrough` mode on the CI server.

To configure your CI server, you will have two options:

1. You can configure your CI server globally by setting `talend.junit.http.passthrough` to `true` as an environment variable.
2. You can configure the CI build job by adding the following option to maven build command `-Dtalend.junit.http.passthrough=true`

That's all you need to do, now your tests run in a simulation mode on dev and in a normal (passthrough) mode on your CI server.

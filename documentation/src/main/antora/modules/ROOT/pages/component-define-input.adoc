= Defining an input component
:page-partial:

Input components are the components generally placed at the beginning of a Talend job. They are in charge of retrieving the data that will later be processed in the job.

An input component is primarily made of three distinct logics:
- The execution logic of the component itself, defined through a partition mapper.
- The configurable part of the component, defined through the mapper configuration.
- The source logic defined through a producer.

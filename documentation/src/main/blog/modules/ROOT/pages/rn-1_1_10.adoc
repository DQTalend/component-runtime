== Starter

You can now automatically pre-configure components from the Component Kit Starter by providing a JSON OpenAPI document.

== Component Configuration

You can now include datetime options to your component configuration class by using the Java Date Time API.
The following classes automatically enable the widget in your component form:

- `ZonedDateTime`

== Validations

Placeholder presence is now validated if the `validatePlaceholder` is set to true. To ensure backward compatibility, this parameter is set to false by default.

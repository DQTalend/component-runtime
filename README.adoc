Talend Component Kit is a framework designed to help Talend components creation for both Talend Studio and Cloud
applications.
This framework unifies the way components are built to ensure they are standardized and easy to deploy in different
environments, as well as 'upgrade-compliant' as Talend applications are getting updated on a regular basis.

Start developing components by generating a project from the https://starter-toolkit.talend.io/[Component Kit Starter]
or by downloading the Component Kit https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10558-talend-component-kit[IntelliJ plugin].



NOTE:

* Maven 3.5 or later is required to build this project.
* the build relies on Node.JS and npm
* the build uses `frontend-maven-plugin` to setup your environment.
